## Design Principles Workshop
There are universal principles that apply to everyone. These are important. However your principles should be unique to your team, product and goals. Your objective is to find specific attributes that inform your work. The best way is to run a workshop with your team.

### Planning
* Plan your workshop well ahead of the start of a project.
* Decide on who should be involved in the workshop. Don't make the group too big but ensure the key decision-makers are present.
* Explain the purpose of the workshop in advance and set a clear agenda. Familiarise your team with Design Principles, what they are and what value they add. Ask your team to take a look at the [examples](/examples) on this site before the workshop.
* Ensure the key people required are invited and able to attend.

### Warm up
Start with a warm-up excercrise.

### Ideation
* Briefly introduce this section of the workshop providing reassurance around the following things:
  * There's no such thing as a bad idea
  * Don't spend too long on one idea, activities will be within time constraints
  * Everyone in the room adds value, make sure everyone contributes and is listened to

### Remember
You're creating principles not set rules. Principles allow for thought and innovation. Rules are more restrictive and don't always convey the principles behind them.
